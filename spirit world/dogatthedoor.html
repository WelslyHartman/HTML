      Huh? Who's there?<br />
      Dog at the front door barking at the air<br />
      Wind all "woosh" in the trees<br />
      Then, "chk-chk-chk-chk," feet on leaves<br />
      Uh, it's probably a cat<br />
      Might be a guy with an ax<br />
      Might be a trap, shit, it's probably a trap<br />
      Might be a possum in the trash<br />
      It's probably a trap<br />
      "Ayy, keep it moving," God, I sound stupid<br />
      Good chance I'm not even talking to a human<br />
      Then again it's probably a trap, somebody had to set it<br />
      Depending on the type, maybe several<br />
      Yeah, that's it, it's probably several, several come together<br />
      To make what would've taken one forever<br />
      I'm thinking it's a pretty damn sophisticated trap<br />
      Utilizing some technology I didn't know we had<br />
      Hmm, maybe I am entirely tripping<br />
      It might've been the neighbor's kid, but I have my suspicions<br />
      I wish it were as simple as a critter, but it isn't<br />
      I feel that it's important we consider all dimensions<br />
      Like, oh, I don't know, maybe it's a trap<br />
      I step onto the lawn, y'all jump out with the bag<br />
      I wake up in some alley on a wholly other plane<br />
      Can't remember who I am or how to get back to the base<br />
      I realize you people think that I am off the deep end<br />
      I'll say that it's a lovely night regardless of the BS<br />
      It is, a perfect snow is freckling the path<br />
      It's almost like the atmosphere is begging for a trap<br />
      The mutt goes quiet, one last sniff, lopes inside<br />
      Fine, it might've been a baby squirrel who tumbled from the nest<br />
      It's probably just you motherfuckers missed<br />
    </p>
