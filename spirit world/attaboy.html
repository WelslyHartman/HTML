      I been floating down the River Styx<br />
      Skipper cap, sipping on what's missing from your mini-fridge<br />
      Insulated slicker dripping, winter like, "It's Britney, bitch"<br />
      Crops wither, docks splinter into popsicle sticks<br />
      Beyond the hissy fit, he ain't but a hound dog<br />
      I'm Bamm-Bamm, pianos fall on me and bounce off<br />
      Vampyrella riding pillion through the eventide<br />
      Indecency that deck the halls, an eye in each Venetian blind<br />
      I'm mеat into the Venus fly, ears back and hacklеs up<br />
      Shifting with the shadow play, I show 'em how to rabbit hunt<br />
      It helps if you're particularly paranoid<br />
      Enough to know there's no such thing as an extraction point<br />
      Attaboy, I'm a sucker for stolen bases<br />
      Bathing in open ocean and shaving in Mobil stations<br />
      Away from the hocus pocus<br />
      The nauseating social codes and motives<br />
      The homies demoted to interlopers<br />
      Look, I can help you tumble through the galaxy<br />
      Somersaulting backwards into vacuous finality<br />
      Shabby chic, overnight a fireball from magic camp<br />
      Inspired by a banzai fly into Manhattan clam<br />
      No hands, pissing off the ferry, mission-ready<br />
      The flesh and blood are present while the rest is vision-questing<br />
      Plugged in, gloves off, shushing all tough talk<br />
      Nowhere to be found at the trust fall<br />
      I'm saying "fuck y'all", live and direct<br />
      I make a Judas shoot a flare up from the Isle of the Dead<br />
      I got a network in the netherworld I seldom reveal<br />
      It get a threat to get to stepping out my energy field<br />
      Behold the nobody who show up uninvited like his 'chute failed<br />
      Blue streak, speak in minor pentatonic blues scale<br />
      Doors blast open for the never not backlit<br />
      Never not eradicating pathogens<br />
      Rat catcher, capture both the flag and the bannermen<br />
      Batter up, throw a badass to the basilisk<br />
      Throw a fucking crab off a mountain top<br />
      Free freefalling with the shuttle parts and flowerpots<br />
      Odd hours, I'm up with the spotted owls<br />
      Spot a coward in the commons how he spot a common mouse<br />
      At a half mile, last-minute mohawk<br />
      Eyes closed, ear to the road salt, all I hear is Mozart<br />
      Gale force winds whipping through your floppy hat<br />
      Glitch in the hologram, trick any polygraph<br />
      Chocolate from the faucet, fish in the lava lamp<br />
      Sofa on the ceiling only come down for karate class<br />
      I'm in pajama bottoms listening to Chaka Khan<br />
      Eating matcha Pocky knocking posses out the polygon<br />
      I see you proper hobnobbing with the la-di-da<br />
      That kind of shit is simply not the way I pop and lock<br />
    </p>
