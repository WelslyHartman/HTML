      Ring around the revenant, let it in<br />
      Said he wasn't ready yet, he never left the Etch-a-Sketch<br />
      Stuck around for more than just a parlor trick or flickering<br />
      fluorescents<br />
      Had a couple still to visit with a million pressing questions<br />
      Like, where you the night of?<br />
      What are you traversing Earth in spite of?<br />
      How are you adjusting to the triumph?<br />
      I'm asking for a friend who caught a loss and never surfaced<br />
      Simply curled up in his cubby, shutting down the central nervous<br />
      Look, float up into urgent care, a checkerboard of blurry squares<br />
      Flowers in the lobby shrivel back into the earthenware<br />
      Humans in the lobby holding crosses up<br />
      I understand the caution but<br />
      Some of you just wanna see the coffin jump<br />
      Until the coffin jump, then it's what I call a punk<br />
      Didn't even get to where he coughing blood and talk in tongues<br />
      Not to mention, once you hassle the hoard<br />
      It doesn't matter how much furniture you stack at the door, yeah<br />
