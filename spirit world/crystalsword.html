      Carry his own water as nary a known other <br />
      Read a palm when I parry apparently no sucker<br />
      Man slash island, casually hammers iron<br />
      Falcons that come to daddy, fabulous cash and prizes<br />
      I'm back of the theater, feature feeding rapid eyes in crisis<br />
      Out of sight is both his fancy and a random act of kindness for ya<br />
      Ride the wild aurora, future bright as fried Gomorrah<br />
      Present tense an SOS in tidal water, final offer, sold<br />
      I been shaking off a death rattle<br />
      As a window-bound bat from a collapsed red flannel at night<br />
      Flight path managing a back and forth<br />
      That draws a heart and dagger if you track it all with tack and yarn<br />
      Six foot a million, nothing off the rack fit him<br />
      I dress like fingers of light through black nimbus<br />
      Ruined last Christmas, probably ruin this Christmas<br />
      You can follow it from wing to cataclysm, listen<br />
      He carry his own water as nary a known other<br />
      Burn sage in the alley with various ghostbusters<br />
      Sea of disembodied bones knocking on your rods and cones<br />
      Some resort to scuba gear, some return to hobbit holes<br />
      Me, I done a lot of both, riding out and running scared<br />
      I'm everything from, "He's a pest," to, "He's been dead for twenty
      years"<br />
      He's been shredding perfect curbs and golden light with total scum<br />
      Pigeons bring him donuts, I'm the motherfucking chosen one<br />
      And every time you liars talk, fish and birds start dying off<br />
      Roses turn to solid ice, quiet eyes to fireballs, um<br />
      I started spilling all my problems to the final boss<br />
      He shed a tear and let me by him like, "What's mine is yours"<br />
      Broke him off a little weed<br />
      Bid him well, off to see a system into smithereens<br />
      Sniffing out some livers he could lose in a broth<br />
      It's when he go and pull the hood from the hawk<br />
      You look lost<br />
      He carry his own water as nary a known other<br />
      Go halves on the carrion, carry-on bolt cutters<br />
      Not a towel boy or cow to the slaughter<br />
      I leave an awkward conversation like a cow to the saucer<br />
      Inspire a thousand Our Fathers, people start calling their priests<br />
      "We've never seen a man so vehemently drawn to the beast"<br />
      "I heard he plays a pipe organ and changes form when he feeds"<br />
      I've never played a pipe organ, the rest my lawyer concedes, okay<br />
      Pull up at the Spirit World, zero man pit crew<br />
      Itching for experience clear of the jellyfish bloom<br />
      Show him to the sickroom, sic him on the showroom<br />
      Show us how you trick 'em into swimming through the au jus<br />
      Devil's trap on the welcome mat<br />
      The dinner jacket smell of hell and back<br />
      I'm working on my hell and forth<br />
      It's bound to be a bumpy ride<br />
      Deeper through the death and gore<br />
      Coming out the other side<br />
