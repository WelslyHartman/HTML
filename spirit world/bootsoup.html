      Over shaking those icy palms<br />

      If I feel surrounded, I might King Kong<br />
      Even now, defy moderation<br />
      My streak allegiant<br />
      My body failing<br />
      I'm east of Eden, not holiday<br />
      And these feet a realized sovereign nation<br />
      Each free to Watusi and do so duly<br />
      At night whеn the zoo get toothy<br />
      A once and futurе goon, own the exit row<br />
      Burn the leeches off, throw the second stone<br />
      Note the pest control, claw the peepers out<br />

      Horseflies that backstroke the boot soup<br />

      One false move, dude, you're a food group<br />

      Bring a steak knife, bring a trail guide<br />
      Breaking out of that boarded house<br />
      Faking normal has worn me down<br />
      Hit the road, an old misanthrope<br />
      Alone, tip me over and pour me out<br />
      Cozy up to that pressure cooker<br />
      My heart's a bottle, my head's a butcher<br />
      My blood a mix of both milk and sugar<br />
      I push the pencil, no pencil-pusher<br />
      Kid been had toxic folk in a sphere<br />
      Kept it afloat, I was frozen in fear<br />
      In the closure, the ghost just won't disappear<br />
      It make the whole globe a road to nowhere<br />
      Joke's on you, I'm going nowhere<br />
