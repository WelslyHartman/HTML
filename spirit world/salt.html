      Severe cold, stare at the code<br />
      Keep a small circle like a deer in a scope<br />
      Let me clear my throat (Let me clear my throat)<br />
      Pocketful of rocket fuel and pyramid stones<br />
      Invoke a spirit from the parallel<br />
      Appearing as unwelcome news<br />
      That drag you to the shadow realm<br />
      And back for show and tell at school<br />
      Promising a future more bedraggled than bedazzled<br />
      When, "It isn't you, it's me," began the dagger to the scabbard<br />
      Free snake tats, plays on train tracks<br />
      Dorm like a door to Hell, the doorbell plays Taps<br />
      Born inside a ring of baffled demonologists<br />
      A casualty of otherness, what the fuck's an olive branch?<br />
      Rats as big as cattle sent to Babylon convulsing<br />
      The home sweet home that sees you as bag of hostile protein<br />
      While I do believe that you believe you're adding to the magic of the
      motif<br />
      Homie, all I hear is, "Dad, I want a pony"<br />
      Fuck the police, I'm floating out with the Camazotz<br />
      Property of nada, runs on Trompe le Monde and Otter Pops<br />
      Roger that, cobblestone beyond the common polygraph<br />
      His middle fingers wear little safari hats<br />
      Chainsaw shave in the house of a thousand tonics<br />
      They're magic if you need a cure for lack of sour vomit<br />
      Son, it's not a thing<br />
      Everywhere I go, I call to make sure there's a fog machine<br />
      Posse up and follow the anomalies<br />

      The rats are back and built their own ship<br />
      They're backstroking faster than the old ship<br />
      A rat's a rat, it scatters, that's like its magic power<br />
      The bowing out it when your house is being smashed to powder<br />
      Ping in the rubble, located burning his bacon<br />
      Ravens deliver him trinketry in eternal damnation<br />
      I make disturbing the stasis a game to beat when the mania boils<br />
      Even the days when the pavement's keeping his platelets<br />
      employed<br />
      Stole an ox on occasion<br />
      I go through wands too quickly to name 'em<br />
      Okay I'll name one, it's the rod of fuck the nonsense<br />
      A basic wave and nod'll turn bravado into fondant<br />
      We slalom from beyond the wildly oscillating compass<br />
      Whether you connect the dots or not is truly not my problem<br />
      Familiar with the color of permanent cloud cover<br />
      Though I've heard there might be others, I'll buy it when it buffers<br />
      Until then a dry and lifeless pile of, "Whys?" and, "Ay carambas"<br />
      In a bubble watching dumpster fires multiply in numbers<br />
      I know that fear and love and death and pride and romance hold<br />
      you by your Chukkas<br />
      Though it's unclear what some closure might encompass<br />
      A bid to visit symmetry from civil war and swim ashore<br />
      Sob story same as yours, but a little more, ha<br />
      I'm in the alley pacing, I'm skirting curtain call<br />
      I make my hospital corners in a circle of salt<br />
