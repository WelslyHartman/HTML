      Bamboo shoots, Buddhas and removed shoes<br />
      Pugilism brewing over whose tuk-tuk's whose<br />
      Moving through the super-moon with goonies off a distant block<br />
      And fugitives from Dusit Zoo in pleasant moods until they're not<br />
      Present mood a startling departure from the temple rules<br />
      Part of it's the temperature, part of it's the tentacles<br />
      AQI alarming, surgical masks marching<br />
      The durian got him gagging, the traffic is anarchy, um<br />
      Siam spy cam, try him in fire<br />
      I'm marigolds and Muay Thai into the eye of the tiger<br />
      I almost died on a scooter, I almost died on a boat<br />
      I figure fuck it, baby, come as you are and die as you go<br />
      North bound, Lopburi, where it's humans: zero, monkeys: one<br />
      Humans fear the monkeys won, get your mirrored sunnies, run<br />
      Later watched a billion bats exploding out a mountain cave<br />
      Climbed a couple hundred feet to stare into the mouth and change<br />
      Descended a little different, every atom individually cleansed and<br />
      repositioned<br />
      That's one unconventional exorcism for the kiddo<br />
      Hearts on his pillow, bars on the window<br />

      Midnight playing sardines to the sleeper car<br />

      OK, heaven is a humid room, it emulate a human womb<br />
      Everyday we celebrate a water birth in noodle soup<br />
      And cruise around as ronin trying to expedite a slow death<br />
      Playing chicken with a family of 5 on the same moped<br />
      Golden lotus that show off a pretty pantone<br />
      And grow in river water that'll melt your fucking hand off, damn<br />
      It's funny 'cause I fake a smile too<br />
      People thinking you're ok until you take 'em to the root<br />
      Imma take 'em to the root<br />
      Through insatiable depravity and layers of abuse<br />
      Down to radiate the truth<br />
      Ok, my homie said "I just got blessed by a monk"<br />
      I said "I got no frame of reference, God is dead where I'm from"<br />
      Still I been doing what I can to get these devils expunged<br />
      Lately it's laying sugarcane across an elephant's tongue<br />
      I'm wading out into the mud to scrub her belly and trunk<br />
      Brushing that yellow off her tusks, shit is better than drugs<br />
      It feels strange, hurdling emaciated strays<br />
      Even stranger days later when I'm no longer phased<br />
      Locals see a space garbage that fell from the interstellar<br />
      Trying to blend in with the smell of peppers, sweat and citronella -
      ella<br />
      Sore thumb in the hum of the helter-skelter<br />
      Rebels huffing through the temple run like Zelda's in the cellar<br />
