      I was at the gates <br />
      Ram's legs, my pizza black, my plants dead <br />
      My planet X, I might bleed green <br />
      I'm what's under the uncut chia seed <br />
      I'm what, what, what, what from the guillotine <br />
      A little flea and tick, a little fever dream <br />
      A little plead the fifth <br />
      Roadkill, I'm off leash <br />
      I don't heel and I'm hung from an unkind mobile <br />
      It turn one misstep into bonemeal <br />
      Look, daybreak, I'm lights out <br />
      My kind sleeps upside down <br />
      It's sci-fi, red tide, my hi and bye make record time <br />
      I go three, two, one, desensitize <br />
      No lie, tell death he could get in line <br />
      K, hellspawn, I'm no joke <br />
      I eat brains, I throw bolts <br />
      I know easy prey, I seen broken oaths <br />
      I go marching in, I'm all, "Oh-ee-oh" <br />
      I know a rodeo from these pony shows <br />
      I don't stay for tea, I can't slow the code, I go <br />
      Coyote, alone and ghost <br />
      I'm in the goddamn smoke, ear, nose, and throat <br />
      Ayy, yo, fresh pot, my favorite mug <br />
      Aes Rock, my day sucked <br />
      Agent of all things deep-sixed <br />
      I feel like I was put here to keep the crypt <br />
      I get tired of bread, I might eat the rich <br />
      I ain't seen a leader, just feeder fish <br />
      You want free weed, you want free shit <br />
      I mean, dude

      Rat tail, my backdrop's all black sails<br />
      Dog bite and my bird curse<br />

      Troglodyte, I might split the blinds<br />
      I'm like Vincent Van with that instant rice<br />
      I write cryptograms at all waking hours<br />
      I tattoo the mail and all paper towels<br />
      I'm on the kitchen walls, I may paint the house<br />
      It could breach the yard, it's omega-bound<br />
      Game face on dour days, y'all gang-gang's like, "How quaint"<br />
      Gangway for that false start vs. freight trains through stalled cars<br />
      Shame, shame, shit's so wack, show you back to this moth jar<br />
      Death wish from day one, I wake up and it rain blood<br />
      Raincheck these fuck shows, I'm donezo, my brain's mush<br />
      Drumroll, I might piss straight, loose tooth in my spit shake<br />
      Every possible Futurama come trooping out of his pill case<br />
      And I ricochet in my steel cage, one still heart and two hill's eyes<br />
      A few meal bars, a good field knife, I feel good, no field guide<br />
      Just deicide by tea at five<br />
      Once ate a whole gluestick in like two bites<br />

      In my PJs and my snowshoes<br />
      About dog fights in those dungeons<br />
