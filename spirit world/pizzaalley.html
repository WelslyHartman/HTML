      Keep it classy <br />
      Key to Pizza Alley<br />
      Weaving traffic in a overheating taxi<br />
      In Lima<br />
      Tickets to liberate the center, pitch surrender<br />
      To a witch doctor pouring amphibians out the blender<br />
      Underneath a glowing purple Christ<br />
      Perfect surf, curl up and die<br />
      Cobblestone alone a masterclass in open world design<br />
      I came from the wasteland in featherlight trail pants<br />
      Fugee off the ant trail<br />
      Inca trail mailman<br />
      Fail in every hemisphere<br />
      Show me the ambrosia<br />
      Maybe ghost into thе coca leaf and holy heliconia<br />
      Wherе shaman opt to zombify undocumented expats<br />
      High and writing Ayahuasca letters back to Melmac<br />
      Dear friends<br />
      Send help yesterday<br />
      Yours true, condor, puma, serpiente<br />
      Talk rap albums over alpaca medallions<br />
      With metalheads who traffic magic flowers from the mountains<br />
      To the houses of the holy<br />
      A token of that sacred valley balance<br />
      So you don't expel omega fatty acids<br />
      The strays in the plaza look happier than my neighbors<br />
      They answer to Paddington Bear in waders<br />
      It's amazers<br />
      What ship, what shore?<br />
      I grew up writing riddles under bridges in New York<br />
      Now I travel like a highwayman who whispers to his horse<br />
      Sharing stories out of winter, trying to trigger something pure<br />
      From "Dying on the vine," to, "It's alive and indivisible"<br />
      To, "How'd I get this far without a bindle full of crystal skulls?"<br />
      Cozy local woven goods<br />
      Beaded shit for people you have never met or spoken to<br />
      But know they'll need to hold Peru<br />
      Throw a couple logs on the fire<br />
      There's a chimney in San Blas where you can hear Baby Dayliner<br />
      Bouncing softly off the navy blue<br />
      April showers, paper moon<br />
      Run the light and beat the drum<br />
      And smoke the dope and raid the tomb<br />

      The local homie blow smoke on his wounds<br />
      And talk about the jungle like it's always in the room<br />
      New and shooting lumens out of a canoe into the ruins<br />
      Silly putty for some otherworldly woo-woo to influence<br />
      Ooh, it's a strange bouquet<br />
      Not today, Supay<br />
      Rubber boots and tumbo juice and tarantula toupee<br />
      Canopy going H.A.M. over camp in a feuding biome<br />
      Os Mutantes row-row-rowing the wrong way into the diode<br />
      Fry the banana, heart of palm ribbons<br />
      Fish from the river, sauces made of citrus<br />
      On a screen porch pimpled after dark with frogs and lizards<br />
      When high as hell, they might as well be Mothras and Godzillas<br />
      It's awesome<br />
      Peer into the spirit quest, spellbound<br />
      Three to one machete, yelling back into the hellmouth<br />
      You hit the labyrinth an ambassador of peace and love<br />
      You might return with the root of your superego plunged<br />

      Mosquitos on the wall of the Amazonian ethos<br />

      We traded numbers and made off into the pond scum<br />
