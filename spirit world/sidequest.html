      I like skating to the store at night in autumn weather with a couple<br />
      layers on<br />
      And maybe Wu playing over soft wheels on a mellow inclined<br />
      plane<br />
      It's those moments I could swear to anything that I'm the ultimate<br />
      Although it goes against the frequency on which I otherwise<br />
      vibrate<br />
      Still an alternate dimension isn't shit to miss<br />
      Do the 'rithmatic<br />
      I been ignoring every ache and pain to push into the lion's own<br />
      gum line<br />
      Navigate a bit of fire and brim, nevermind whatever transpire<br />
      within<br />
      I'm out the other side a golden beam of lost sunlight<br />
      You take a brittle bone out for a little spin, I'm mostly into outer<br />
      space<br />
      Or underneath a haunted freeway overpass, around a storm-worn<br />
      flat square<br />
      Kicking wooden toys around and vandalizing random city property<br />
      A proper way to pencil-in a Saturday without cab fare<br />
      Bulldozer dozing over every brick or black top<br />
      Spin the backdrop<br />
      Metropolis or in the pretty backwoods<br />
      Bring wax, thanks bye<br />
      Black ops, all flat spots<br />
      Rat-a-tatting in forgotten back lots<br />
      Steady feel a pull to power-slide around brake lights<br />
      See him off into the fog<br />
      Figure 8-ing in the moon<br />
      Never let him know the odds<br />
      It isn't part of how I move<br />
      See him off into the foul<br />
      Celebrating in the road<br />
      Never let him know the count<br />
      It isn't part of how I go<br />
