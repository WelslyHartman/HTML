      I never don't float with the four winds<br />
      Sweat cold, piss warm, make war films<br />
      No doors on the forcefield, radio ahead<br />
      I log any palpitation of the web<br />
      Whether aphid or angel of death<br />
      Entertainment or threat<br />
      By the end, you're a savory crepe<br />
      Models that mar every orbit and corner, it's horrid<br />
      There's more exhibition than voyeur, oh boy<br />
      Cold dawn mist incarnate<br />
      Every day, I wake up in a different carcass<br />
      If I climb out quiet I'm myth before tea<br />
      I see no need to initial the tree<br />
      I seem to have run out of skin on my teeth<br />
      I look like I feel like a fish in a beak<br />
      I look like a dick in my picture ID<br />
      But also the pic isn't me, huh<br />

      Some days on the road to make, he miss<br />

      Blood rain, I'm a phase of the forecast<br />
      Storm through space like a blade through stored fat<br />
      Graze over the gate in the gore-fest<br />
      Ain't really play to the neighborly format<br />
      Great, baited adventuring out of his norm is a lesson in mapping<br />
      the doors<br />
      Anything more in the lap of the gods<br />
      Anything less an imbalance ignored<br />
      Seems like even the ragtag grab bag<br />
      Raise eyebrows when your rat pack quack quack<br />
      Spitfires that kiss the pitch dark<br />
