      I'm a glutton where the food still shimmy and shake<br />
      Not a fingerprint to pin him to a physical plane<br />
      Probably show up as an isolated pocket of cold<br />
      Got a way of making tilapia hop in the boat<br />
      I was fending off a lizard on the dock of the lake<br />
      In Siem Reap, smoking something I forgot how to say<br />
      Maybe twenty paranoia, eighty plotted against<br />
      Palm reader calling in his archaeologist friend<br />
      It's been a long and bitter breakup with the science of sleep<br />
      I'm through the lobby on my stomach with a knife in my teeth<br />
      Brave winter, rain slicker over mutinous code<br />
      Finally free of all you fuckers I should pull through a phone<br />
      I could transform later when the gradient fade<br />
      There's a paranormal energy awake and engaged<br />
      There's a Kawasaki out behind a barn in Angkor<br />
      Money said if you could start it, it's yours<br />

      In the pitch dark searching for the source of the hex<br />
      Got a loyal tentacle in every corner of heck<br />
      Hooded figure from the wreckage of an alien ship<br />
      Nescafé washing down a snake on a stick<br />
      Spotted floating down a river tryna curse in Khmer<br />
      With no shirt, seven days worth of dirt in his hair<br />
      When the motor finally folded to the accident prone<br />
      Had to flag another captain, phantasm in tow<br />
      I've been ignoring any semblance of relatable Earth<br />
      I got a homie from the region who could name every bird<br />
      And tell you what it is to wake up with a tank in the yard<br />
      Type of shit to make you question what your days even are<br />
      There's a holy waterfall where you could rinse and repeat<br />
      Find religion while the minnows eat the skin off your feet<br />
      If you wake me on a January morning at four<br />
      Don't get excited when I bark at the door<br />

      Y'all keep not being shit, all I do is chomp at the bit<br />
      Caltrop in his foot, still hop to the bridge<br />
      All rah, rah, a pox on your kin<br />
      Pass through the prism, maintain position<br />
      Knock over everything, walk away whistling<br />
      False name, I work at a fake business<br />
      Daybreak 'til I break up into trained pigeons<br />
      And I came from the cave paint, chase painkillers<br />
      Tailed by an arcane shape in the scribble<br />
      I stake out snakes that forsake the sigil<br />
      Wait 'em out, show 'em how the wavelength ripple<br />
      I'm afraid they don't wanna see a wound-up truant<br />
      Get to walk down a street to the sound of doves cooing<br />
      Doves like, "I love what you doing, even when it's drugs at the ruin"<br />
      Money, I was plucked from the fire, jumped back in the fire<br />
      It's fucked, you're free to hire another pathfinder<br />
      Skull and bones humming the tones that don't bode well<br />
      Only if you may have built an altar at the hotel, oh well<br />
