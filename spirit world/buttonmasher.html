      They figure, "What's a little tape on the wings?"<br />
      A little glue, a little paint, a little staple and string<br />
      You won't believe how far the garbage when that radio ping<br />
      Behold a view or two where you could lose your voice at the moon<br />
      I hope you like your beef and veggies with the moisture removed<br />
      Dig it, the low rider, lower the gold visor<br />
      Nosedive guided by the ghost of Laika, my heavens<br />
