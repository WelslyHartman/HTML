      I shouldn't even be here, mum's the word<br />
      I burn down the house, I gum up the works<br />
      I'm the wrong vibration to summon to Earth<br />
      When the cuffs break, better make enough of the cure<br />
      I go proto-human, I'm so unruly<br />
      Architect of my Kodokushi<br />
      En garde, hop in the box of chopped arms<br />
      On the blocks beyond the pop art stockyard<br />
      Got a red phone right to the inside<br />
      I could turn a ribcage into windchimes<br />
      You don't wanna engage, kiddo, it's a burden to bear<br />
      It's a whirlybird, nervous in the surface-to-air<br />
      I lost count of the cooks, every coward and crook<br />
      Every memory or semblance of an, "Out of the woods"<br />
      I'm two unrubbed elbows well in the weeds<br />
      Even the good eye couldn't find the edge of my seat<br />
      Oh, potpourri of confusing powers<br />
      All mashed together and shooting outward<br />
      Intel gleaned from the prince of dark<br />
      Scarecrow every ten for infinity yards<br />
      When a spirit and vessel consider living apart<br />
      It's official, I ain't sign up for the mission to LARP<br />
      My call of duty stay all-consuming<br />
      Even if y'all see him as a dollar movie, look<br />
      Best in show, I'm the worst there is<br />
      That pest control is no urban myth<br />
      That floating skull just won't shut up<br />
      It's on a business trip from below the crust<br />
      Y'all know what's up<br />
      Bad news from the black lung<br />
      Used to flatline, the shit is so last month, yo<br />
      I don't need money to burn, I need sunsets, purple and mother of<br />
      pearl, c'mon<br />

      Territorial organisms<br />
      Each glorifying our poor decisions<br />
      I'm a force, you could forecast swarming insects<br />
      Who eat all the corn like war is business<br />
      I pageant wave from my shallow grave<br />
      Patch me in from that astral plane<br />
      Ain't ring the bell, I pass through the walls<br />
      A cool burgundy in both tooth and claw<br />
      Midnight manage an incredible feat<br />
      A GPS collar on the neck of the beast<br />
      It go, beep-beep, any neck of the reef<br />
      Put a reaper on a second week of medical leave<br />
      I'm a seer, I could tell you how the curtain descend<br />
      Or maybe hint at how it isn't with a circle of friends<br />
      I go bah with the black sheep, rah rah, catch me a patsy<br />
      Spaz, unravel, and blaspheme<br />
      Riddler to keep the gate<br />
      It's a groundhog D-Day, Jesus H<br />
      I was born on a horse at a steeplechase<br />
      My forte's frontline real estate<br />
      Plus steak and frites, I take bloody as hell<br />
      If it burn black, point him at the honey and milk<br />
      I ain't sitting while you sully the well<br />
      I turn up in a jiff, jackknife when I jump in the pit<br />
      One hundred hands, one million eyes<br />
      Two bleeding gums, I will survive<br />
      That last line's rose-colored only for a limited time<br />
      It all shifts when you militarize<br />
      I had a vision of a feather on a seasonal wind<br />
      In the shadow of a gargoyle fleeing the brick<br />
      Lean in, steal your chips<br />
