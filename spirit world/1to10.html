      Bad back, bad back, bad back<br />
      One half zig while the other half zag<br />
      Stand too long and the whole shit hunch<br />
      Sit too long and I can't stand up<br />
      Gramps out for a Sunday drive<br />
      A man as betrayed by his lumbar spine<br />
      Who pull up to the spot like, "I'll meet y'all inside<br />
      I need like five"<br />
      Corpse pose, staring at the moon<br />
      Entirely on fire, Sciatica to boot<br />
      I'm ready to be turned into soup<br />
      Or shot into space, or squashed into cubes<br />
      "Rate your pain level on a scale from one to ten"<br />
      I said, "Well doc, I tell you, I feel like I lost a friend"<br />
      I'm usually okay to simply shut up and cope<br />
      But these days more than ever, my back is like, "Nope"<br />
