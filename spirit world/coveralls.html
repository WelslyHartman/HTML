      I could give a fuck if there's mold on my daily bread<br />
      I'm a foe to the fainting goat, I'm at home on the razor's edge<br />
      Over the garden wall when your Rover was playing dead<br />
      Arm-in-arm with a melancholia, roses and baby's breath<br />
      Slow to reveal a signal from deep in the tub of tiger balm<br />
      Lighter lit, giant slalom circumvent the psychopomp<br />
      Womp womp, circle to the watering hole<br />
      Something secluded where the spoon stand up in the joe<br />
      Pursue a puff of smoke who never hum or trumpet his post<br />
      From unassuming to the poltergeist of multiple homes<br />
      Ultimate weapon, slow the pulse to a crawl<br />
      "Sir, we had thought he was toast"<br />
      That's when the elbow drop from off of the ropes<br />
      Family approach him like he sat up in his coffin and spoke<br />
      We only talk in awkward hello after awkward hello<br />
      Most of my visitors request that I be tied to a chair<br />
      I wear the skin of my detractors, maybe try not to stare<br />
      Yeah<br />

      I buy a second seat for my extraordinary piss and moan<br />
      Feet up while the fleet assemble, keep the devil in the hole<br />
      With several yelling, "Sparta," you were yelling, "Marsha, Marsha,
      Marsha"<br />
      Only one'll read the chapter after larva, it's a good one<br />
      I'm haunted by Atlantic water bade adieu<br />

      When all you want is happy feet in hammocks under azure blue<br />
      Have you any marrow past the ballyhoo or no, sir?<br />
      No, it's mostly snotty noses pressed to empty zoo enclosures<br />
      going<br />
