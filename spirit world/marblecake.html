      Born garbage day, warden of the shawarma plate<br />
      Fork a naked eye, and trade survival tips with tardigrades<br />
      Ephemera burning where the morning look like haunted marble<br />
      cake<br />
      Parkas and pajama pants, I'm part of what don't march-in-place<br />

      Smoking out the local protein, brokering the rabbit punch<br />
      I'm broken, fuck a focus group, fuck your folk, and Toto too<br />
      The produce of a pencil-neck who never met a social cue<br />
      Eye of the archfiend, appetite for alpha dogs<br />
      Step into the party with a killing jar and shadow box<br />
      Like "Who invited acid wash?", I'm shopping for the mantelpiece<br />
      Overkill is catalogued and crammed into banana leaves<br />
      Polaroids around him like a visit from the Vantablack<br />
      Miniatures in Biggie shirts and minutes that he can't get back<br />
      It isn't just gorillas in a camera trap, it triggers<br />
      The history pack a little aftermath in every image<br />
