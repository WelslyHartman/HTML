      I drag in the cat that drag in the conversation piece<br />
      Yahweh-forsaken elite, hemlock in the pot every day of the week,<br />
      I'm a lot<br />
      Reach in, even the odds or evolve into mystery meat for the broth,<br />
      who's еatin'?<br />
      Scream for his mom all evening, moxiе a seasonal fog<br />
      Palmful of grease, skied through "Keep Out" signage<br />
      Weed in his sock, beacon of snot<br />
      Knee-deep evil to plot through a fever, maid threw his Rod of<br />
      Asclepius out<br />
      Spring and bell exploding through my Polartec<br />
      Got a soul and vessel, don't coalesce<br />
      Got a nosy compulsion to overstep<br />
      I write 8-bit maps for the so depressed<br />
      From the croc in the moat to the gold in the chest<br />
      Notice I don't program any actual way to progress<br />
      To convey an effect<br />
      Hot Vinyasa to bated breath<br />
      That fray, that plague, that bayonet<br />
      That hate, that face of death<br />
      That all-in together, I'm afraid that train has left<br />
      I ain't wade through bullshit or baby step<br />
      Pop off into flesh, no beta test<br />
      I bump Raising Hell, I make raisin bread<br />
      Raised on wolf's milk and Eraserhead<br />
      I'm all good<br />
      Quietly hacking away at a hideous riff on the formula<br />
      What is the work if it isn't a ticket to slip into vivid euphoria?<br />
      Huh?<br />

      (One, two three four)<br />
      Ayy, grey beard, wayward<br />
      Parade wave and vacate the framework<br />
      Phased out, trade for blank tapes and bait worms, eek<br />
      Ease in the weeds, no safe word, K?<br />
      No kayfabe, all true tales from the pay grade<br />
      Heavy on malaise and away games<br />
      The tiptoe tailed by a trail of craters<br />
      I am way too Canis Major, et tus?<br />
      Let me guess, you tout the brave few<br />
      Then make Jesus take the wheel by day two<br />
      I don't really pander or plan to behave<br />
      If the police sketches a hand from the grave, unholy<br />
      Don't luminol the upholstery<br />
      His poor old Nonna would roll on her rosary, I know<br />
      I go from a homie to bogey and ghost<br />
      I'm sorry if you know me as both<br />
      I still float hearts from the haystack<br />
      I give free hugs in a plague mask<br />
      I don't trust none of y'all's love to be more than a cheap toy gun<br />
      with a bang flag<br />
      Ayy, sultan of simple fare<br />
      No lie, roll by, we can lick the air<br />
      It's an appeasement gesture, not a rib tip rare<br />
      But the bistro don't split silver hairs<br />
      I made peace with a lot, but a lot of it sits<br />
      Still, genuine props on the bottomless pit<br />
      Backseat drive with a lazy drawl<br />
      I don't aim to please, I don't aim at all, I'm okay<br />
      Actively seeking to underdevelop his sentimentality<br />
      Why am I here if it isn't effectively cutting the hellions out of me,<br />
      huh?<br />
